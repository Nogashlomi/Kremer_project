= Abstract

= Clustering "Same Images" and Potential Use of Results: the example of image programs
this section shoud explain:
1. the clustering of same images in the the sphere corpus: how and why was it done
2. the idea of using it: calculating "programs" of shared and unique images accompanying the specific text parts
3. presenting the technical process (how is it done)
4. presenting the "results" (graph)
5. reflection of potential "problems" like clusters that should be merged, double pages. maybe something else

= Examples for Historical Analyses Based on the Results/ Findings (temporary title of course)
this section should include three examples for "interesting cases" found using the "image program" code for identifying shared and not shared images.

== part 104: 
the image of multiple positions of the sun in the orbits of the sun model, cluster 1967


b. part 100: 
two variations of the ship image: 1303, 03216
the eclipse image: 1506, 1504
seven climes image: cluster 3669
additional "angles": 2016, 3664, 155

c. part 370:
-ephemerids of the moon with and without lines - clusters 1504, 806
-an additional lathe machine image showing one moment in the motion (only one semi-circle) - cluster 85

part 251:
cluster 1519 (signs of the zodiac, table like image)
clusters 477 and 261: sun and moon

part 238
cluster 486: the ring with the stone

part 190: a treatise about the stars
addition of astrolabe and a three dimensional diagram. clusters: 1236, 3754/870 (there is more than one of these clusters)

part 184
ecclesticus (with the sanke), addition of the sun and different appearance of the moons 3694 (similar cluster 1504)

part 110, addition of lathe machine to geonmetrcial definition of a sphere, clusters 1941, 1823

d. potential overview: text parts that have more or less "non shared image clusters" (historical meaning: text parts that has stable image program vs. text parts that has more variations in the image programs)


= Discussion
this section should discuss:

a. the concept of how a sequence of images is part of the visual language, that images don't stand on their own but "operate" as a group

b. tradition and innovations: to discuss how strong traditions of illustrations provide a solid base for innovations and their transmission and reception

c. the "potential" of clustering in image corpora for identifying interesting cases in visual language evolution

d. the idea that image programs are not necessarily text-dependent, and have a life of their own (we are looking for cases in which the text stays the same and images are added to it)
