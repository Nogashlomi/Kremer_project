= Clustering "Same Images" and Potential Use of Results: the example of image programs
this section should explain:
1. the clustering of same images in the the sphere corpus: how and why was it done
2. the idea of using it: calculating "programs" of shared and unique images accompanying the specific text parts
3. presenting the technical process (how is it done)
4. presenting the "results" (graph)
5. reflection of potential "problems" like clusters that should be merged, double pages. maybe something else

= Examples for Historical Analyses Based on the Results/ Findings (temporary title of course)
this section should include three examples for "interesting cases" found using the "image program" code for identifying shared and not shared images.

== The Theorica nova planetarum by Peurbach (part 104)

/*intoduction of part 104*/
The Theorica nova planetarum planetarum is an advanced treatise explaining the structure and motions of the planetary astronomy./*continue introduction to the treatise*/
The treatise was printed with a prominent set of illustrations that were probably made by Peurbach himself. The printing of these illustrations is considered innovative. They are big and beautiful diagrams, thus founding a standard and tradition of a diagrammatic aesthetic./*improve*/
The stable and systematic visual language of the treatise is considered one of the reasons for the success of the treatise./*ref: pantin, malpangotto*/

/*findings through Jochen's tool*/
Through the program-identifier tool we were able to identify an image that is included in nine out of the ten copies of the theorice nove planetarum in the sphere corpus: cluster SAC_SIL_01967.
This image also appears in the theorica of gerard.
/*how many copies of the theorice of gerard in the corpus?*/
The image is then not included in the commentaries on the theorica peinted a bit later/*insert exact years*/ and was not found to appear in the Theorica corpus which includes more XXX editions of this treatise.

/*interpretation of the image*/
This image expresses the theorica of the sun, presenting the "model" of the sun's orbits (to use pantin's words) but shows the sun in a number of locations throughout its motion. 
By this method, the image express the motion of the sun and can aid the understanding of varied constallations that are formed during its yearly, daily, and longer courses of motion.

/*interpretation of pattern*/
The image seems to be very prominent in the corpus, but to not be included in later commentaries and in the theorica corpus. This potentially highlights "the power of the program." The extension from the traditional set of images did not "survive." This image does not fit in the systematic image system of the theorica, offering one "model," and one more graphically simple image to express lines and motions. The combination of the two was not succesfful, maybe due to its "deviation" from the systematic character of the image program.

== The Tractatus de spheara by Sacrobossco (part 100)
/*found clusters cases
b. part 100: 
two variations of the ship image: 1303, 03216
the eclipse image: 1506, 1504
seven climes image: cluster 3669
additional "angles": 2016, 3664, 155
*/

/*introduction to the part, its commentaries, and its illustrated tradition*/
The original text of the Tractatus de sphaera is the prominent "text part" around which the database was formed: the Tractatus de sphaera by Sacrobosco.
The treatise included illustrations already in its manuscript copies. With the beginning of print a prominently illustrated tradition was established.
Many commentators based their writings on Sacrobosco. Those commentaries were also illustrated.

/*research question for program identification: part 100*/
What happens to the illustrated tradition of the Tractatus throughout the corpus?
Through the program finidng tool we were able to identify some shifts.

=== Seven Climate Zones
/*seven climate zomes example*/
One cluster that was found to be not common to varied editions of the Tractatus original part is a cluster presenting the seven climate zones within the five zones system. 
/*it is important to check what is going on with other clusters because the graph shows a nice picture that might not be true*/
This image cluster is seen in the graph to start to appear in commentaries at the end of the fifteenth century, and around the early-middle decades of the sixteenth century to be printed with the Tractatus original parts themselves.

/*seven climate zones interpretation*/
Images showing the seven climes are printed with the original Tractatus are seen from XXX. However, this cluster represents a combination of two opinions presented in the text. In other words, the image "tries" to consolidate to concepts together. In this sense, the image functions as a type of commentary. The addition of such image to the original part show a sort of wide and basic "acceptance" of this point of view. It can demonstrate how a certain perspective becomes tacit/ common knowledge.

=== Eclipses and Ephemerids

Two image clusters that were found using the program outlier identification tool/*think about this name*/ found two clusters representing eclipses and ephemerides of the moon. The review shows again how these images were adopted from commentaries into the original treatise.
This shows how the illustrative tradition of the Tractatuse evolves from the commentaries.
/*compare with other eclipse images from part 100, look at the commentaries this cluster originated from*/

== part 370
clusters: 
-ephemerids of the moon with and without lines - clusters 1504, 806
-an additional lathe machine image showing one moment in the motion (only one semi-circle) - cluster 85

== part 251
part 251:
cluster 1519 (signs of the zodiac, table like image)
clusters 477 and 261: sun and moon

== part 238
cluster 486: the ring with the stone

== part 190: a treatise about the stars
addition of astrolabe and a three dimensional diagram. clusters: 1236, 3754/870 (there is more than one of these clusters)

== part 184
ecclesticus (with the sanke), addition of the sun and different appearance of the moons 3694 (similar cluster 1504)

== part 110 
addition of lathe machine to geonmetrcial definition of a sphere, clusters 1941, 1823

== potential overview: 
text parts that have more or less "non shared image clusters" (historical meaning: text parts that has stable image program vs. text parts that has more variations in the image programs)


= Discussion
this section should discuss:

a. the concept of how a sequence of images is part of the visual language, that images don't stand on their own but "operate" as a group

b. tradition and innovations: to discuss how strong traditions of illustrations provide a solid base for innovations and their transmission and reception

c. the "potential" of clustering in image corpora for identifying interesting cases in visual language evolution

d. the idea that image programs are not necessarily text-dependent, and have a life of their own (we are looking for cases in which the text stays the same and images are added to it)
